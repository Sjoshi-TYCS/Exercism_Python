    "# Rotational Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on\n",
    "transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an integer key\n",
    "between `0` and `26`. Using a key of `0` or `26` will always yield\n",
    "the same output due to modular arithmetic. The letter is shifted\n",
    "for as many values as the value of the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general notation for rotational ciphers is `ROT + <key>`.\n",
    "The most commonly used rotational cipher is `ROT13`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `ROT13` on the Latin alphabet would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n",
    "Cipher: nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is stronger than the Atbash cipher because it has 27 possible keys, and 25 usable keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ciphertext is written out in the same formatting as the input including spaces and punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROT5  `omg` gives `trl`\n",
    "- ROT0  `c` gives `c`\n",
    "- ROT26 `Cool` gives `Cool`\n",
    "- ROT13 `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.` gives `Gur dhvpx oebja sbk whzcf bire gur ynml qbt.`\n",

    "# Atbash Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on\n",
    "transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting\n",
    "alphabet is backwards. The first letter is replaced with the last\n",
    "letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\n",
    "Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is\n",
    "a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have\n",
    "been an issue in the cipher's time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size\n",
    "being 5 letters, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it harder to guess\n",
    "things based on word boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`\n",
    "- Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`\n",
    "- Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",

    "- Python 2.7: `py.test atbash_cipher_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.4+: `pytest atbash_cipher_test.py`\n",

    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest atbash_cipher_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a diagram, determine which plants each child in the kindergarten class is\n",
    "responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants. The teacher\n",
    "thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in\n",
    "actual dirt, and grow actual plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills, and\n",
    "planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the available\n",
    "types of seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[window][window][window]\n",
    "........................ # each dot represents a cup\n",
    "........................\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 12 children in the class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,\n",
    "- Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,\n",
    "- Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row. Their teacher assigns cups to\n",
    "the children alphabetically by their names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram represents Alice's plants:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[window][window][window]\n",
    "VR......................\n",
    "RG......................\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first row, nearest the windows, she has a violet and a radish.  In the\n",
    "second row she has a radish and some grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with\n",
    "the row nearest the windows. From this, it should be able to determine\n",
    "which plants belong to each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",

    "VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- Violets, radishes, violets, radishes\n",
    "\n",
    "While asking for Bob's plants would yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clover, grass, clover, clover\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exception messages\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to\n",
    "indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not\n",
    "every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include\n",
    "a message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of\n",
    "`raise Exception`, you should write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "raise Exception(\"Meaningful message indicating the source of the error\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the tests\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the tests, run the appropriate command below ([why they are different](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1629#issue-161422224)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 2.7: `py.test kindergarten_garden_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.4+: `pytest kindergarten_garden_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest kindergarten_garden_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
    "- `--ff` : run failures from previous test before running other test cases\n",
    "\n",
    "For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`\n",
    "\n",

    "Given students' names along with the grade that they are in, create a roster\n",
    "for the school.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade\n",
    "  - \"Add Jim to grade 2.\"\n",
    "  - \"OK.\"\n",
    "- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade\n",
    "  - \"Which students are in grade 2?\"\n",
    "  - \"We've only got Jim just now.\"\n",
    "- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.  Grades should sort\n",
    "  as 1, 2, 3, etc., and students within a grade should be sorted\n",
    "  alphabetically by name.\n",
    "  - \"Who all is enrolled in school right now?\"\n",

    "- Python 2.7: `py.test grade_school_test.py`\n",
    "- Python 3.4+: `pytest grade_school_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can tell Python to run the pytest module (allowing the same command to be used regardless of Python version):\n",
    "`python -m pytest grade_school_test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `pytest` options\n",
    "\n",
    "- `-v` : enable verbose output\n",
    "- `-x` : stop running tests on first failure\n",
